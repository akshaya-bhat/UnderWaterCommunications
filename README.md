# Scuba Chat (Under Water Communications)

## Goal
Our project aims to develop an underwater communication device using a transmitter and receiver system. 

Given the limitations of RF transmission underwater, our approach utilizes ultrasonic waves for effective communication. 

This type of underwater point-to-point communication is useful in many situations including scuba diving, underwater cave exploration, underwater robotics, and scientific research endeavors.

Our transmitter and receiver designs will use many of the same concepts as a regular radio, albeit adapted to accommodate ultrasonic transducers instead of RF antennas. 

As part of our stretch goals, we aim to build on top of the minimum design by enabling two-way communication, implementing a user-friendly front-end interface to send and view messages, and encasing the device in waterproof material to facilitate underwater operation.
 
Our minimum viable product entails the development of a transmitter and receiver equipped with waterproof transducers, enabling message transmission upon immersion in water.
