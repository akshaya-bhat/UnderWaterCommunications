# Troubleshooting
### Rx Arduino is reading a lot of noise when not in water
1. Make sure the Rx Arduino is not connected to the gray USB extender

### To view timestamps in the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
1. Open the Serial Monitor by going to Tools/Serial Monitor
2. Toggle timestamp by clicking on clock icon in the upper right corner of the Serial Monitor tab
